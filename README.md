# Gwtish
A 3d ui,style and interaction library for libgdx
Makes it easy to add streetsigns, readable newspapers or even interactive computer terminals to your game.

Whos it for?
- LibGDX users working on 3d games or apps
- GWT users looking to make 3d games using a familiar syntex to what they are used too

Whoes it not for?
- LibGDX users working on 2d games, or games where all the text is over the 3d, would be better of using Scene2D built into gdx
(ie, if Occusions arnt a concern)

Pros/Cons of alternatives;
- GWTish is likely slower then other options, and likely still has bugs.
- Using Scene2d and converting to a texture via a frame buffer:
- Using static prebuilt textures:

GWTish strengths:
- Quickly add text to your game

- These objects are model instances ready to use
- Text looks good upclose thanks to a Distance Field Shader
- Change text whenever you like easily;
- Make the object interactive easily:
- CSS like styleing...
- Even css like animations..
- Build complex layouts using various panels;
